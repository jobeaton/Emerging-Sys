# Thermostat

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I had to utilize temperature, timer, UART and give funcionality to the buttons on the board
# What did you do particularly well?
Went smoothly overall. It functioned without any bugs or errors.
# Where could you improve?
I need to work on the comments/documentation so that it will be easier to read when I look back at it.
# What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I2C, UART, GPIO, Timer, and the CC3220S microcontroller
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
C programming and any project relating to embedded programming.
# How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code works and should be able to be implemented again if needed. Slight changes might be needed if it is a different microcontroller.
